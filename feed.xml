Luckily, there’s a neat little trick you can do to resolve this issue for most limits: L’Hospital’s Rule, named for Marquis de L’Hospital, who learned the results from his tutor Johann Bernoulli, and published them in 1696. This rule tells us that when an indeterminate form such as \(0/0\) or \(\infty/\infty\) is encountered, one can simply take the derivative of the numerator and denominator and evaluate the limit again. Using the example above</p> \[\begin{align*} \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x}{\sin x} &amp;= \lim_{x \to 0}\left(\frac{\frac{d}{dx} x}{\frac{d}{dx} \sin x}\right) \\ &amp;= \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{\cos x} \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{\cos 0} \\ &amp;= 1. \end{align*}\] <p>Formally, L’Hospital’s Rule is defined as follows</p> <p><strong>Theorem (L’Hospital’s Rule).</strong> <em>Let \(f\) and \(g\) be continuous on an interval containing \(a\), and assume \(f\) and \(g\) are differentiable on this interval with the possible exception of the point \(a\). If \(f(a)=g(a)=0\) and \(g^\prime(x) \ne 0\) for all \(x \ne a\), then</em></p> \[\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f^\prime(x)}{g^\prime(x)} =L \implies \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=L.\] <p>This is pretty awesome, and can even be applied multiple consecutive times. But why does it even work?</p> <h2 id="derivatives-and-the-mean-value-theorem">Derivatives and the Mean Value Theorem</h2> <p>First, let’s recall the definition of a derivative. Given a function \(h: A \to \mathbb R\) and a point \(c \in A\), the derivative of \(h\) at \(c\) is defined as</p> \[h^\prime(c) = \lim_{x \to c} \frac{h(x)-h(c)}{x-c},\] <p>provided that the limit exists. If \(h^\prime\) exists for all \(c \in A\), we say that \(h\) is differentiable on \(A\). In order to analyze L’Hospital’s Rule, we also need the <em>Generalized Mean Value Theorem</em>, which states</p> <p><strong>Theorem (Generalized Mean Value Theorem).</strong> <em>If \(f\) and \(g\) are continuous on the closed interval \([a,b]\) and differentiable on the open interval \((a,b)\), then there exists a point \(c \in (a,b)\) where</em></p> \[[f(b)-f(a)]g^\prime(c) = [g(b)-g(a)]f^\prime(c).\] <p><em>If \(g^\prime(c)\) is never \(0\) on \((a,b)\) then the conclusion can be stated as</em></p> \[\frac{f^\prime(c)}{g^\prime(c)} = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}\] <p>This is a bit random and comes out of nowhere, but is actually an extension of the <em>Mean Value Theorem</em>, which is a bit less complicated to understand.</p> <p><strong>Theorem (Mean Value Theorem).</strong> <em>If \(f:[a,b] \to \mathbb R\) is continuous on \([a,b]\) and differentiable on \((a,b)\), then there exists a point \(c \in (a,b)\) where</em></p> \[f^\prime(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.\] <p>The Mean Value Theorem is one of the most important results from real analysis. Simply put, it states that for any function \(f\) continuous on the interval \([a,b]\), there exists some \(c \in (a,b)\) such that the secant line joining points \(a\) and \(b\) is parallel to the tangent line at point \(c\).</p> <h2 id="proof">Proof</h2> <p>Armed with this, we can prove L’Hospital’s Rule. Assuming we have two functions \(f,g\), that the derivatives of both at \(a\) exist, and that \(g^\prime(a)\) is never zero, we have</p> \[\begin{align*} \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} &amp;= \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{g(x)-g(a)} \tag{generalized MVT} \\ &amp;= \lim_{x \to a} \frac{\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}}{\frac{g(x)-g(a)}{x-a}} \\ &amp;= \frac{\lim_{x \to a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}}{\lim_{x \to a}\frac{g(x)-g(a)}{x-a}} \\ &amp;= \frac{f^\prime(a)}{g^\prime(a)} \end{align*}\]]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="math"/><category term="math"/><category term="calculus"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ft. the Mean Value Theorem]]></summary></entry></feed>
